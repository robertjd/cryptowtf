## pbkdf2 examples for Node.js libraries

Node.js 10.x does not support HMAC-SHA256, only HMAC-SHA1

Here are some examples of how to use pbkdf2 with HMAC-SHA256, using these 3rd party Node.js libraries:

* [cryptocoinjs/pbkdf2-sha256](https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/pbkdf2-sha256)
* [digitalbazaar/forge](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge)
* [bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl](https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl)

Install the node libraries with `npm install`

Run it with `node main.js`
